# Track Cars

Web page that displays a map and several points on the map and updates it in real time. The point positions are served by a Node.js backend. It is to simulate a tracking mechanism for several objects moving across a path e.g. a fleet of cars in an organization.

## Project
The project consists of two parts:
1) Backend - subdirectory "server" - HTTP server created based on [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework
2) Frontend - subdirectory "client" - web application build with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Each item contains its own README file. Please refer to this file to run the applications properly.
